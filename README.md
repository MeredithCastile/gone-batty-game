# gone-batty-game

A meditative, bat-themed side-scrolling game inspired by Flappy Bird. Guide your bat through a cave, flapping to stay aloft and avoiding stalagmites and stalactites. The game is designed to be easy, relaxing, and visually retro. This is the first app I developed and deployed in a single day. It's visually scrappy, obviously, but is an archive of my learning.
